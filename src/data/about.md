# Intro

Hi! I'm a tech and crypto enthusiast(should be obvious enough if you see me taking this far to create a web3 page for my crypto profile). My experience in crypto space can be divided into these categories:
- cryptocurrency exchanges arbitrage
- Investment
- Crypto Chart Pattern Analysis
- EVM smart contracts developments and interactions
- NFT projects


# crypto journey
- My journey through cryptocurrency and web3 started in the end of the year 2016, when I was introduced to a shitcoin (totally forgot the name, fortunately I dumped it early) by one of my senior colleague. Then I bought some eth and XRP using my instant noodle fund, these decisions changed my life forever.

- Then I engaged in inter-exchange arbitrage (not fiat-crypto but crypto-crypto), before the cryptocurrency skyrocketed and the bubble bursted in 2018.

- My second wave of involvement was in 2021, when I started to do liquidity mining and yield farming.

- Also in 2021, I started to look into the NFT space more closely, and decided to launch two projects (Aeonheroes and Percepx Arts) while in the same invested in some metaverse/NFT projects.
 

# Reasons to Believe in Cryptocurrency and Web3

- Bitcoin is a sound money (read "The Bitcoin Standard")
- Ethereum (and basically every other L0/L1) is a revolutionary technology (read "The Infinite Machine")
- NFT is a natural way to record ownership on the digital space as the information flow democratized by blockchain/DLT(it's not just about jpeg or metadata!)

# My Inner Compass (precaution: I like to mix things up)
- Reformed Thomism
- Calvinistic literalism + Ancient Fathers' allegorism
- Moderate instrumentalism + scientific realism (thanks to David Deutsch, even though I find his book hard to understand)
- Ancient greek ethics + Kierkegaardian existentialism
- Liberalism ( more precisely, I was a classical liberal, now trying to love the modern one, with mixed success)
